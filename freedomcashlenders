 Payday loans and personal loans have the same essential characteristics common to all loan types. Money is borrowed for a period of time, at a specific interest rate, and must be paid back by a specific date. Furthermore, the money borrowed can be used for a variety of reasons, although the payday lender doesn’t need to know the loan’s purpose, while the personal lender will probably ask.

However, these loans vary significantly in ways that can have a big impact on the borrower: the approval process, the cost of the loan, the length of the repayment period, the risk of added debt, and more.
