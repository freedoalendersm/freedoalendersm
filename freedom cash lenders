Customers of Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of the investing giant, will now be able to get cash loans by placing their Bitcoin (BTCUSD) as collateral with its digital asset custody solution. The company has linked up with crypto-lending service BlockFi, which will provide the cash loans, for the service.

Customers of both firms can receive 60% of the total amount for a cash loan, if it is backed by a digital asset. But that percentage figure is not set in stone. Zac Prince, CEO of BlockFi, told Bloomberg that there was "room for client-level customization (in the loan terms) and (the program) may be adjusted to meet the needs of large firms."
